Point Nine Repeated
or, What One Is
 _  
.9 = 1
I hold that this is true,
because I was convinced, 1 time.
Not because I know the proof.
I would have to reference the Internet to suit your incredulity.
Unless you already knew.
 _  
.9 = 1

Believe me or not, there is no argue.
Because I was convinced, twice 1 time!

Now, what I want to know is:
Why can't I imagine why?

I can prove that I don't understand, if needed:
If I did, then there would have to be
something special about point n repeated,
Where n is only limited by my imagination.

So, then, why can't I imagine the fact that is true?
Because it never burned my skin?
Because it never poked me in my good eye?

OH! But I can IMAGINE all of those nines!

I can imagine a conga line of nines!
1 after the next, fore to tail, 
dancing in 1 infinite loop.
And scattered about the barn
here and there
1 nine, plus 1 n of nines, 
where n makes it a group.

A few more nines keep time
1 with a banjo
1 whistling, 
1 stomping boot
1 with, what is that, a pipe or a flute?
1 with 1 tooth.

That 1 in the corner is actually two, 
1 of whom is roughing his suit.

And some 1s mirror loved 1s, in the photo booth.

All of sudden 1 nine hollars, 
"Hey all you decimals, point to your right."

Which is left to us.

Well, scratch my imagination. 
Poof goes the proof. 
And all is 1.
