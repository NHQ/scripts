## Planck's Clock

In the beginning there was only one thing, but nothing was possible.

Nothing was possible because there was only one thing.

A state of being that would go on forever as one.

Nothing was also possible because if there was one thing, what would the one thing be if it wasn't?

Nothing.

Therefore, in the beginning, there was one that was, and one that wasn't.

One of being, One of !being   

One of, One !of

One, !One

Plancktime is the smallest unit of relative time in the physical universe.

The samplerate of the universe is one second divided by one plancktone

There are 2e^44 planctons per second.

Upon the 1st tick of Planck's clock there was one thing, but a not thing was possible.

On the 2nd tick, the one could obtain, or it could become !one.

And the not thing could obtain, or it could become a one.

Thus 2 possibilities became 4.

Upon the 3rd tick, the 4 possibilities became 8 possibilities

Upon the next tick, the 8 possibilities became 16

And on the next 16 became 32 possibilities

then every next tick, for each possibility, for each there were two possibilities

So that after the first second of time, there was already 2^e^44 possible outcomes, 

beginning with only one
