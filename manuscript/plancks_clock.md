In the beginning there was nothing possible
Then God created the possibility of exactly two states
One state of being   
One state of !being   
Therefor upon the 1st tick of Planck's clock
there were two states possible
Then on the 2nd tick
the 2 possible states, for each
there were two states possible
then on the 3rd tick
the 4 possible states, for each
there were two states possible
then on the 4th tick
the 8 possible states. for each
there were two states possible
then on the 5th tick
the 16 possible states, for each
there were two states possible
then every next tick, for each 
every possible state, for each
there were two states possible
