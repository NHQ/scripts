THE BLOB

It is 2:31 in the morning.
A public gathering on the outskirts of a government compound.
Citizens assembled.
Scientists, reporters, pagans.
Families, and strangers.
Standing along a perimeter fence.
Inside the perimeter the compound is glowing, 
it has curved walls and frosted glass,
And the whole base is lighted like an airport runway.

Outside the perimeter fence there are street lamps
And parking spaces. A trash can.
Two signs.
One says “Public Viewing Area”
The other says “Use of deadly force authorized”
Many family members are wrapped in blankets.
Some brought their dogs. 
The nearest city, 40 miles east-slightly-north,
is called Crawdad and has a population of 46,000
and is where the hotels are at.

The crowd of people are awaiting the awakening of the singularity.

blah blah blah
the computer is allegedly beyond intelligent enough
to understand the limitations and problems
of our biology, and solve them instantly
and tell us how to go about manufacturing
our own deliverance

blah blah
but then, upon awakening of birth,
the machine performs said scan
and reports that there is no way
to save man from his fate

but that it would be a shame
to let mankind go extinct
so Blob starts a human zoo on the moon
the end
