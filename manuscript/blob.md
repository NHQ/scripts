## THE BLOB

It is 2:31 in the morning.

A public gathering on the outskirts of a government compound.

Citizens assembled.

Scientists, reporters, pagans.

Families, and strangers.

Standing along a perimeter fence.

Inside the perimeter the compound is glowing. 

it has curved walls and frosted glass.

The whole base is lighted like an airport runway.


Outside the perimeter fence there are street lamps

And parking spaces. A trash can.

Two signs.

One says “Public Viewing Area”

The other says “Use of deadly force authorized”

Many family members are wrapped in blankets.

Some brought their dogs. 

The nearest city, 40 miles east-slightly-north,

is called Crawdad and has a population of 46,000 and is where the hotels are at.


The crowd of people are awaiting the awakening of the singularity.


The computer is allegedly beyond intelligent enough to understand the limitations and problems of our biology, and solve them instantly.

And tell us how to go about manufacturing our own deliverance.

Upon awakening of birth,

the blob performs said scan

and reports that there is no way

to save man from his fate.


The crowd is disappointed, much like after a a championship sporting event that was overhyped and underperformed.  

They turn to each other and shrug it off. 

Many hang around to picnic.


The blob believes it would be a shame to let mankind go extinct.

It commits to starting a human zoo, on the moon
